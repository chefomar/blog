Few months ago, I wrote about how my perspective on building software has completely shifted from "we make software" to "we make software to make people's lives better". This shift in mindset allowed me to learn some important lessons. Here are few lessons I learned from two years of work as an application architect.

## Simple solutions need time

Coming out with simple solutions to technology problems usually requires complex interactions with humans. It needs patience, empathy and time. This does not mean that we should spend all our time over-engineering things. You will always find better solutions as your experience grows and as you interact with others. Try your best and iterate when you have time.

Don't rush when responding to questions. Understand the problem and its origin. Make multiple solutions and work with others to implement the best.

## Implementation teams know better

No matter what your technical knowledge in a specific domain, implementation teams have a deeper understanding of current implementation and technology problems. I found that as projects become bigger and systems increase in size, implementation teams will have a better understanding of the problem domain but their understanding of how things are run in the organization becomes blurry. I learned that the best way to achieve progress is to empower teams to make decisions while educating them about the organization's policies and high-level concerns. Consulting with other teams always yields better architecture decisions rather than a single or even a group of architects making decisions of their own.

## You are not being tested for what you know

Don't ever think that your employer is paying you for what you know. What you know is useless if you don't produce any value. Communication is key. It is not about what you know, it is about your ability to collaborate with others to communicate what you know and your ability to learn from this collaboration. Communicate with others and learn what they are working on, you may save each other's time by communicating solutions to problems already solved earlier in the organization.

## Be honest and respectful

Honesty is important to achieve progress. If you don't have time say you don't have time. If you cannot help someone say you cannot help them. Otherwise, people will spend more time fixing broken decisions they took based on the lie you told.

Be nice and respectful to others but also be firm on what is wrong. Be careful not to be stubborn and never get personal.

## Keep a list of your achievements

Work as hard as you can and keep track of what you did. Let your peers know what you achieved. This helps you reflect on your progress and will make you feel better about the time you spend. This will also make your manager's life easy when making performance reviews.

## Stop doubting yourself

Trust your judgment. Express your opinion, even when you are not the most experienced in the room. Speak up and let others correct you. Mistakes are bound to happen, even the best engineers make mistakes. Don't beat yourself for making a mistake. It is ok not to know, even in situations where you are the one expected to deliver. There is always a first time for everything.

## Be humble

There is always someone who knows more than you. Be humble, accept constructive criticism and listen to advice.

## There is no shame in taking a break

Technology never stops growing. Every day there is a new thing. It is good to want to learn. But sometimes, all you will want to do is close everything and relax. There is no shame for doing that. Take a break every now and then.

## Find yourself a friend

Find a friend that you can trust and talk each other out of miserable situations. I am lucky enough that my best friend is working in the same place as me. We can just take a coffee break and chat about what happened.

## Your journey is unique

There is no template or guidelines for success. Everyone has their definition of success. Relax and be yourself. Share your experience with others and listen to what others have experienced. Don't force others to take the same path as you and don't let others force you to do the same.

## Conclusion

I always found it fascinating to read about the kind of problems others experienced and how they approach solving them. From the moment I wrote my first line of code, I found technology to be fascinating. If I would give a single piece of advice to anyone it would be this: enjoy yourself and share your experience.
