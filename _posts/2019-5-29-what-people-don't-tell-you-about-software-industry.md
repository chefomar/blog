I have been working in software industry for about two years now and I have to say, my perspective on the industry has changed entirely.

## It is all about code

Initially, I believed that all I had to do is take some requirements and write some code that does what the requirements say. How hard can that be? I mean, it always worked that way in collage. Turns out that is not the case in the real world.
Everyone talks about how programming language x is better than y, how you must learn framework z to get a job or how you can make all sorts of cool stuff with code. Even job interviews, most of the questions are focused on what you know and don’t know.

## Fancy titles, dirty work!

Shortly after my graduation, I got a job with a senior position: Application Architect. A job that many people with much more experience than me wish for. I was excited and worried at the same time. Will I be able to perform with whatever technical knowledge I have? I mean, I know Javascript, but they mostly work with Java, will this be enough?
With time, my worries about my technical knowledge began to fade away. Sure, I was lacking in many areas, and still do, but I learned quickly. I started worrying about something else. I felt like I was doing something wrong, but I didn’t know what it is at the time. I was solving people’s problems. For every problem that comes to me, I suggest a solution. So what was I doing wrong?

## A search engine for tools

I was not solving any problems. I was stuck at my desk all day researching what tool can potentially solve whatever problem people have. To make this even better, some people come with a tool or vendor in mind. I was basically working as a search engine for tools and vendors. I didn’t spend time communicating with the people who have the problem. Sometimes I didn’t even know who had that problem.
I was not doing that alone at work and I am sure we are not the only people in the world that did and still do this.

## Software is not the problem

I later realized that software is not the problem. Our deployments were delayed, so we brought an auto deployment tool. People were taking much time doing manual builds and tests so we brought a continuous integration tool. Projects were getting delayed so we tried to do Agile. Still, work was not getting done, people were not happy, and projects are still getting delayed.

## Conclusion

Imagine if we woke up tomorrow and all the technology that we have today stopped working. Sure people will find it difficult to get things done, but they will eventually adapt. People were doing businesses without technology. People ruled countries without any of the technologies present today. Technology comes and goes. Only people remain.
There is only one important thing to remember if you work in the software industry: People are all that matters. Software is no good if no one likes it. Software is no good if no one knows how to use it. We build software to make people’s life easier.
